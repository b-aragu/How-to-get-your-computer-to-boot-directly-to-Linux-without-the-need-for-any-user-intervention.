After the computer start push F10 and go to  the System Configurations - open Boot Options

Check Customized Boot on

Check off SecureBoot

Boot Mode: choose UEFI Hybrid or UEFI Native (I chose UEFI Native)

UEFI Boot Order: put Customized Boot to the top

Define Customized Boot Option: choose Add + put the setting: \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi

Found out that the correct path string when opening the GRUB via the Boot from EFI File option in the Fast Boot Options (F9). In the beginning, the options list contained:
      OS boot Manager
      Boot from EFI File
After adding the Customized Boot option, it was added to the list:
     Customized Boot
     OS boot Manager
     Boot from EFI File
Save changes and exit the systems configuration 
press F9 and choose customised boot and your system will power on 
You can try to restart it and hope it can now start automatically.
Hope this works, you can share it to help others facing the same issue
