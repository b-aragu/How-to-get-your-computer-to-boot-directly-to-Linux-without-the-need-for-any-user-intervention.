after computer start push F10 - go to System Configuration - open Boot Options):

check off Secure Boot and also Legacy Boot.

Save the changes and exit systems configuration.

Press F9 and choose Boot from EFI File i.e /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi

Ubuntu will start and once you get into ubuntu 

Open the terminal using CTRL+ALT + T 

Use the command below to check where the windows boot loader is located 
    
    $ sudo efibootmgr -v
     
 most likely the original boot loader is in here:
 /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi (Please note that in your computer it might be in a different place. If so, you will need to adjust the commands below.)

 Make a backup of that file by moving it one level up:
   
    $ sudo cp /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi
    
Finally, copy GRUB2's boot loader in that place, "tricking" the system into loading the boot loader you want instead of Windows' original boot loader:
        
       $ sudo cp /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi   
     
finally you have dual boot working with GRUB2. In case Windows overwrites the boot loader again after an update (as it did with me), you already know the steps to get grub back to its place.
Hope this one helps
